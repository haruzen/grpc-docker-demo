Functional Proposals Aligned with Real-World SaaS Architecture

1. üîí User-Based Task Management

Allow users to log in and manage their personal tasks.

Tech Used: Cognito (JWT), API Gateway, Node.js REST API

Behavior:

Users sign up and receive JWT tokens via Cognito.

Each request to /tasks must include a valid JWT.

Node.js REST service extracts user ID from the token.

Tasks are stored and filtered per user.

Real-World Analogy: Like Trello, each user sees their own task board.

2. üìà Admin Dashboard for Task Insights

Admin users can view all users' task summaries and analytics.

Tech Used: Cognito Groups, Node.js (Admin role check), REST endpoint: /admin/overview

Behavior:

Only users in "Admin" group can call this endpoint.

JWT token must include group claim.

Returns data like number of tasks per user, last activity.

Purpose: Role-based control using JWT claims.

3. üöÄ Triggering Python gRPC Worker for Task Analysis

Offload heavy processing (e.g., sentiment or keyword extraction) to gRPC worker.

Tech Used: Node.js REST (caller) ‚áí Python gRPC Service

Behavior:

When a task is created or updated, Node.js calls the gRPC service.

Python service processes text, returns metadata (e.g., keyword tags).

Results are saved with the task.

Real-World Analogy: Like Notion auto-tagging or Jira recommendations.

4. ‚è≥ Asynchronous Notifications via Lambda or Queue

Notify users of task changes asynchronously.

Tech Used: AWS Lambda, SQS or SNS (optional)

Behavior:

When a task is created, send event to Lambda.

Lambda sends email or push notification to user.

Purpose: Event-driven architecture for decoupling features.

5. üîç Search Feature with API Gateway + Lambda + ElasticSearch

Allow users to search their task descriptions and tags.

Tech Used: Lambda function with Elasticsearch query

Behavior:

Frontend or client calls GET /search?q=term

API Gateway triggers Lambda, searches indexed tasks.

Real-World Analogy: Like Notion or GitHub issue search.

6. üìä Monitoring and Logging with CloudWatch

Track usage, errors, and performance.

Tech Used: CloudWatch + API Gateway Metrics + Lambda logs

Behavior:

Monitor login failures, task API usage, gRPC calls

Add alerts for errors or slow responses

üìä Optional DevOps Enhancements

Use GitHub Actions to run automated tests before deploy.

Use Ansible to install monitoring agents or audit logs on EC2.

Use Docker healthchecks and NGINX to reroute on failure.
